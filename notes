# first we installed node.js and npm
# we created a folder where we installed requried dependencies
#   ---- npm install
    ---- npm init -y
    ---- npm install --save express
    ---- npm install ejs --save
# this created nodemodules, package-lock.json, package.json

# to start project, we created index.js in main folder
# created a folder called public which contain folders "css","js", "img"
# created a folder called pages inside views folder which is in the main folder

# create a local server. purpose of nodejs is to create a server to serve pages to the user

# to create server we use express. we import express using var express= requrie('express')
#                                                          var ejs = require('ejs')         


#we create an opject to use the express. lets name object as app
#  var app = express();

# to send any in information 
# app.get('/', function(req,res){
#  res.send("Hello");
# })

#-> function is a callback function which gives response res for request req.

# but where to look at the server? app.listen("port number");

# we need to tell express where are requried html files are present? app.use(express.static('public'))
# we set view engine to ejs. app.set('viewengine','ejs')

#inside pages folder we create our html files. can also be named ejs
